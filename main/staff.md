## Our team
We appoint members to our team to make sure everyone's doing the right thing. Every member of our team is chosen to be a supportive member of the server; to keep the server open, and available to everyone. Our staff members serve the members, and everyone has the right to get in contact with those in charge.

<h3 class="exec-h3">Executives</h3>
Executives are in charge of all lower positions; they have the ability to remove and appoint staff members, and manage permanent punishments. You probably won't see these staff members in-game often because they also are responsible for the Discord server, and community advertising.
