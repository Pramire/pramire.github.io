## About the man
"Who in the world is Brian Krebs, what does he do, and why is he a candidate?" --*The unknown voter.*
{: .usa-font-lead }

[Brian Krebs](https://krebsonsecurity.com) is a security journalist and reporter of the investigative variety, born here in the United States -- and since '05, has been authoring some of the leading articles on computer security. Before working in the field of cybersecurity; he was an editorial aide for the department of editing, and desk of finance at [The Washington Post].

Now, he is a man with immesurable experience in cybersecurity and criminal investigation; and, by this campaign, has been deemed as ideal for the effective governance of Edison High School.

### For student council treasurer...
The lifetime experience of working in journalism, coupled with working in the financial sector for a significant period of time, affirms the concept that Brian Krebs is the most suitable candidate for EHS' student council 'treasurer' position.

*"I have worked with (Brian) Krebs, and his overall knowledge of security -- along with finance -- has been proven invaluable by his work." -Richard.*

### For humanity...
Krebs is a family man, with a wife and kids; and, while devoted to his work, does not disregard those he cares for. Brian has an outstanding compass of logic and political precision; for being loyal, while remaining bipartisan. He's the product of civility, cordial attitude, and competence.

*"I may stand (as a) witness to this man's amazing morality, and sense of self-awareness. For the good of the nation, it's best he run it." -Dennis.*

## Candidate's background
The candidacy of Brian Krebs has historically stood for empowering privacy, and the alleviation of poorly-secured services; both across local and federal government. He's been active in the campaign-space for a significant period of time.

Krebs for America was founded just last year, to help provide resources (and information) to the supporters of Brian Krebs; and secondly, to spread information regarding treasurer Krebs.

### Late '16
The campaign to support Brian Krebs and then-candidate Chairman Reyolds was initiated; and textual information to support the campaign, along with his co-runner, was planned and 'sponsored' by Krebs for America.

A logical backing from [esoForum](https://esotalk.net) ensued, which now provides the services under the name 'Krebs for America'; and to this day, the esoForum service fully backs Brian Krebs for the student council.

### Early '17
Krebs' campaign expanded from a spot in the numerous candidates, to an element of the student's core values; with Brian Krebs-related content soaring among the creative spaces of Edison.

Brian Krebs was, and remains, the sole candidate to receive a backing from two non-profit organisations; and the school's principal ([Clay Vinyard](https://twitter.com/clayvinyard)). Krebs is also backed by [Google LLC](https://www.google.com/about/our-company/).

### Currently
As of now, the Krebs project is at the highest point of support it's ever been; and currently, we're working to continue embellishing the prospects of a Krebs-lead treasury.
